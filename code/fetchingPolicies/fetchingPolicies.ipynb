For example, we may redesign the Apps to make it easier for you to search for restaurants in Foursquare City Guide or to earn points or rewards in the Panel App from Placed. We also use your Data to customize our Apps and Sites to provide you with your own personalized experience. We do this by inferring your interests and preferences, looking at your search history, or in the Foursquare Apps, by allowing you to find and add friends who are also using the Foursquare Apps and Sites from your device’s contact list or, if applicable, your Facebook, Google or Twitter account, if you have opted to connect these accounts to your Foursquare account. In these situations, we do not store your contact lists.',\n",

For example, we may identify where you shop and the places you visit to help our partners measure the success of a media campaign, to categorize your mobile advertising identifier in an interest-based segment based on where you shop or visit, or when partners use our SDK, we may receive certain Partner End User Data back (e.g., wifi end points, Visit Data, and other Data), including Data about Foursquare Users, if the Partner End-Users are also users of our Consumer Services.
