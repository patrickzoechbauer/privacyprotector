Our registered office is at De Strubbenweg 7, 1327 GA Almere, Netherlands. We are a company registered in the Netherlands, with company number 39092006.

This privacy and data policy (“ **Privacy Policy** ”) applies and has effect in respect of all online services and other software and services made available by us (together the " **Service(s)** "), as well as any other online features relating to the Services including our websites for events and product promotions (the “ **Websites** ”).  Together the Service(s) and Website(s) are referred to as the “ **Online Services** ”.

For more information about our cookies and how we use them, please refer to [this page](https://tradetracker.com/privacy-policy/how-we-use-cookies/) or [click here](https://aboutcookies.org/) of you're looking for  information about cookies in general.  


We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. The Privacy Policy explains the basis on which personal information we collect from you will be processed by us or on our behalf. Where we decide the purpose or means for which personal data you supply through these Online Services is processed, we are the “data controller”. We will comply with all applicable data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation2016/679.

In some instances, we may be a joint data controller, with advertisers and publishers which participate in our network from time to time (our “ **Partners** ”).  You can find information on our Partners on our Websites. If you would like to know more about how one of our Partners makes use of your personal data, please ask to see their privacy policy.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully as it contains important information about the following:

\- What information we may collect about you;

\- How we will use information we collect about you;

\- Whether we will disclose your details to anyone else; and

\- Your choices and rights regarding the personal information you have provided to us.

This Privacy Policy forms a part of and should be read in conjunction with our terms of use in respect of the Service, if you have entered them in a personal capacity.

If you would like to know more about how we use cookies, please view our cookie policy which can be found [here](https://tradetracker.com/privacy-policy/how-we-use-cookies/).

Our Website may contain hyperlinks to services owned and operated by third parties. These third party services may have their own privacy policies and we recommend that you review them. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third party services and your use of these is at your own risk.

We may make changes to this Privacy Policy in future, which will be posted on this page. You should check this page from time to time to ensure you are aware of any changes. Where appropriate we may notify you of changes through the Services.

## 2\. Our online services

We operate an affiliate marketing network. This means we have established a network of online merchants who want to promote their products and services online, and we are able to connect them with a network of online publishers which are able to display advertisements for those products and services. Publishers may operate websites, apps or other (digital)services.

Our role is to help advertisers and publishers understand which advertisements displayed by publishers have generated which sales, leads or other actions for advertisers. This allows advertisers to pay a publisher only when the advertisement displayed (or any alternative required action) by the publisher refers an individual to the advertiser and that individual makes a purchase.

We use data, including cookies, to achieve this understanding. This data relates to individuals, but does not identify them by name. It relates to a single referral by an individual from one website to another, and then a confirmation that a purchase was made.  We also maintain a database of references to individual’s devices, so that we can understand whether an advertisement viewed on one device, for example a phone, caused a purchase to be made by that individual on one of their other devices, for example a laptop.  This database does not allow people to be identified by name.

We do not build profiles which show individuals internet usage over a period of time. We also do not target individuals with advertisements for products and services based on their perceived interests. Our role is simply to measure the effectiveness of specific online advertisements.

Therefore, if you click on an advertisement on one website, and then complete a transaction on the website to which you were referred, we may process your personal data so the publisher of the advertisement can be paid for displaying that advertisement.

If you would like to know more about our Services and how we comply with data laws, you can read our Whitepaper [here](https://tradetracker.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GDPR-adv_pub-whitepaper.pdf).

We also operate our own website and we consider how users navigate that website so we can improve it, make it more useful and appealing, and remove bugs or other errors.

## 3\. Information we may collect about you

When you use our Online Services we collect and process the following information which may include your personal data.

#### (“ **Partner Information** ”)

We will maintain a record of your journey from one website to another for up to 365 days, and also a confirmation of whether you have completed a purchase from the second website as a result of that journey.

This takes the form of a cookie, and other information to allow us to identify your devices. This may be achieved by recording device IDs or by recognising combinations of device attributes.

Finally, advertisers will tell us information about what products and services you may have bought, but they do not provide information that could allow us to identify you.

#### **Information collected for the purposes of providing analytics** **(“Analytics”)**

We may collect technical information about your use of the Website through the use of tracking technologies and analytics. This information does not allow us to identify you.

## 4\. Why we collect information about you

We will use Partner Information to provide our Services to Partners, as described above. We also use Partner Information to prevent fraud.

We do this on the basis that it is in our legitimate interests to do so, having considered any consequent impact on your rights to privacy.

In some instances, advertisers ask us to collect other data from their website and relating to website users. We only do this on instruction from our advertisers.

#### **To operate our Website**

However, this is on the basis that they do not make independent use of the information, and have agreed to safeguard it.
