## Your Privacy is Important to Us

 **Last Updated: 06-05-2019  **

Click [here](https://pages.postmedia.com/privacy-statement/#technology) to jump down to Use of Technology and learn more about recent updates to our targeted advertising services, including how you can opt-out. 

Postmedia Network Canada Corp. and its affiliated and subsidiary entities, including Postmedia Network Inc. (“Postmedia ”, “we” or “us”) are committed to protecting your privacy and safeguarding your Personal Information (as defined below) we always strive to be transparent about the data we collect about you, how it is used and with whom it is shared. The Postmedia Privacy Policy (available[ here](http://www.postmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Postmedia-Privacy-Policy-Final.pdf)) and this Privacy Statement (collectively, the “ **Privacy Policy** ”) describe how we may collect, use and disclose Personal Information of subscribers, customers, site visitors, etc. (collectively “ **you** ” or “ **Users** ”). The Privacy Policy applies to all Postmedia [websites](http://www.postmedia.com/brands/), applications, and services (each a “Property” or, collectively, “Properties”). These Properties may be subject to change from time to time in Postmedia’s sole discretion.

In this Privacy Policy, you will also see references to “ **Customized Experiences** ” which describe content, advertising, and offers (including third party sponsors or advertisers) that are tailored to you based on information that we’ve collected from your interactions with our Properties.

By visiting our Properties, subscribing to our services or submitting your Personal Information for any reason, you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

Postmedia may modify this Privacy Policy and, if we make material changes to it, we will provide notice to you (at www.postmedia.com, by email or both), to provide you with the opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. If you object to any changes, you may close your account or unsubscribe. You acknowledge that your continued use of our [Properties](http://www.postmedia.com/brands/) after we publish or send a notice about our changes to this Privacy Policy means that the collection, use and sharing of your Personal Information is subject to the updated Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to personal information that we collect, use or disclose for journalistic purposes. It does not cover information that is not personally identifiable, such as anonymous or aggregated data, which cannot be associated with a specific person (“Non-Personal Information”). Non-Personal Information may include, without limitation, information about when and how Users interact with our Properties, demographic statistics about our Users, IP addresses, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language and other transactional information. This information is typically used by Postmedia, its advertisers or audit bureaus.

###   
USE OF TECHNOLOGY 

### How Does Our Technology Monitor Our Properties?

Postmedia’s Properties may place technologies (typically small data files) such as “cookies”, “web beacons”, “tags and scripts”, and local storage objects (“LSOs”) such as HTML5, that websites or applications commonly write to your computer or device and contain information that can help identify you each time you visit one of our Properties. Postmedia uses these technologies to measure website and application activity and traffic patterns, to log your activity, to develop analytics, and to store your reading and behaviour history. If and to the extent that we share any of this information with third-party vendors and advertising networks to deliver advertisements on our Properties, it is shared as Non-Personal Information. Third parties may also place and access these or similar technologies on your devices for the purpose of delivering Customized Experiences such as advertisements directed at your interests. Postmedia does not have access to, nor control over, the use of tracking technologies by such third parties. As such, the placement of these third-party technologies on your computer or devices is subject to the terms, conditions and policies of such third-party vendors and advertising networks. You may choose to set your computer or device to reject these technologies. However, some features available on our Properties may rely on these technologies, and any rejection of the same may impact your ability to use features on our Properties.

#### How Do You Manage The Use of Advertising Technologies?

Postmedia is a member of the Interactive Advertising Bureau of Canada (IAB Canada) and follows industry standards for online advertising. The majority of advertisements displayed on our Properties are served through one or more reputable third party advertisement-serving companies, including Google. You can control advertising technologies, such as cookies, via the [Google Ad and Content Network Privacy Policy](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en). If you are interested in obtaining more information about Customized Experiences in advertising and how you can control technologies that are being placed on your computer or device by other companies, you can visit Google’s “[How Google Ads Work](https://privacy.google.com/intl/en/how-ads-work.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=ad-settings&utm_campaign=inbound-site-link)” page. Additionally, Postmedia ePaper products (digital versions of our printed newspapers), are maintained by PressReader and are therefore governed by [PressReader’s Privacy Policy](https://care.pressreader.com/hc/en-us/articles/205818089-Privacy-Policy).

Postmedia’s Properties may contain links to other third party websites for your convenience and information. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any third party websites.

 **Political Advertising**

Postmedia supports responsible political advertising on our Properties and will accept political ads by all registered Canadian political parties. New in 2019 is the requirement under Bill C-76 requiring digital platforms accepting regulated political advertising to maintain a digital ad registry. Postmedia’s ad registry can be found at [adregistry.postmedia.com](http://adregistry.postmedia.com/).

Political party advertisers may run political, election and issue related ads, provided that the political party complies with applicable laws, including campaign and election regulations. Political ads may be static (displayed to all users) or targeted (displayed to some users). Static ads are placed on our Properties and do not change, regardless if the website is refreshed and regardless of who visits that site.

Targeted advertising involves directing political ads towards a group or “segment”, made up of persons who share similar general identifiers or behaviours, but cannot be individually identified. See EXAMPLES OF TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED, STORED AND USED above for the type of information we may collect and use for targeted advertising

Effective on June 14, 2019, if you wish to no longer receive targeted political advertisements, you can opt-out at any time at [adregistry.postmedia.com](http://adregistry.postmedia.com/). Please note that if you opt-out, you may still receive non-targeted, static advertisements of a political nature. You may also need to opt-out of tailored advertising delivered by Postmedia from any other device or browser in which you access our Properties.

 **Ad Blocking**

Postmedia helps to fund journalism efforts through the use of advertising. As part of our Terms of Use, Postmedia reserves the right to refrain from providing any service, including access to Postmedia Properties, to Users using ad blocking or other means of circumventing advertisements.

#### Collection and Use of Usage Information 

From time to time, we collect certain usage information from our servers that relates to the use of our Properties. We use this information for statistical analysis and to improve our Properties, for example, by enhancing pages or features that are visited frequently. On occasion, we may share this information with our affiliates or other third party vendors or service providers to provide them with an indication of the amount of interest in our Properties for advertising purposes and to help us plan for technical improvements.

#### To Whom Do We Disclose Personal Information? 

We will share your Personal Information with our affiliates to provide and develop our Properties. We may also combine information internally across the different Properties covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Properties be more relevant and useful to you and others.  
Postmedia may share your Personal Information with third party service providers in order to enable them to provide services on our behalf. We use third parties to help us provide products and services on our Properties (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, marketing and development). They will have access to your information as reasonably necessary to perform any tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. Some service providers may be located outside of Canada where Personal Information may be subject to the laws of those jurisdictions.

We do not share your Personal Information with any third-party advertisers or ad networks for their own advertising use except for: (i) hashed or device identifiers (to the extent they are Personal Information in some countries); (ii) with your permission or (iii) data already visible to any Users of the Properties. However, if you view or click on an ad on or off our Properties, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they may, through the use of cookies, identify you. Advertising partners can associate Personal Information collected by the advertiser directly from you with our cookies and similar technologies. In such instances, we seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so.

It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith reasons to believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you, (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, (4) protect the security or integrity of our Properties (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of our Users, personnel, or others. We attempt to notify Users about legal demands for their Personal Information when appropriate, in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand.

We can also share your Personal Information as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your Personal Information, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.

You may see a list of our third party vendors [**here**](https://pages.postmedia.com/vendors/).

#### How do we retain and safeguard your personal information?

We retain Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and as permitted or required by law. We have implemented physical, organizational, contractual and technological security measures to protect your Personal Information from loss or theft, and unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.

We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks. However, we cannot warrant the security of any Personal Information that you send us. There is no guarantee that Personal Information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

We process data both inside and outside of Canada and rely on legally-provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders. Countries where we process data may have laws which are different, and potentially not as protective, as the laws of your own country.

We will only collect and process Personal Information about you where we have lawful bases. Lawful bases include consent (where you have given consent), contract (where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you and “legitimate interests”.

Where we rely on your consent to process Personal Information, you have the right to withdraw or decline your consent at any time and, where we rely on legitimate interests, you have the right to object. If you have any questions about the lawful bases upon which we collect and use your Personal Information, please contact our Data Protection Officer as listed at the end of this Privacy Policy.

#### How can you access your personal information?

We will make available to you any Personal Information that we have collected, used or disclosed upon your [written request](https://pages.postmedia.com/privacy-statement-old/gdpr-request/). This includes data that you or others provide to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Properties. We will attempt to respond to your written request within thirty (30) days. We will advise you in writing if we cannot meet your request within this time limit.

We provide many choices about the collection, use and sharing of your Personal Information, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile and controlling the visibility of your posts to advertising opt-outs and communication controls. We offer you settings to control and manage the Personal Information that we have about you.

For Personal Information that we have about you:

  * Delete Personal Information: You can ask us to erase or delete all or some of your Personal Information (e.g., if it is no longer necessary to provide products or services to you). 
  * Change or Correct Personal Information: You can edit some of your Personal Information through your account, as applicable. You can also ask us to change, update or fix your Personal Information in certain cases, particularly if it’s inaccurate. 
  * Object to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Personal Information: You can ask us to stop using all or some of your Personal Information (e.g., if we have no legal right to keep using it) or to limit our use of it (e.g., if your Personal Information is inaccurate or unlawfully held).
  * Right to Access and/or Take Your Personal Information: You can ask us for a copy of your Personal Information and can ask for a copy of Personal Information you provided in machine readable form.



We retain your Personal Information even after you have closed your account or terminate a subscription, if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, or fulfill your request to “unsubscribe” from further messages from us.
