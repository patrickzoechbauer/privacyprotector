# Privacy Policy | Sovrn Publisher Monetization Solutions

### Sovrn Holdings, Inc. Services Privacy Policy

**Posted Date:** December 18th, 2020  
**Effective Date:** January 1st, 2020

Sovrn Holdings, Inc. (“ **Sovrn** ” or “we”) provides this privacy policy (“ **Privacy Policy** “) to describe our and our subsidiaries’ information practices for our Publishers and Consumers (together, “you”) who use the Sovrn Services. Capitalized terms are defined in this Privacy Policy. For information on our information practices for our websites offered to our Publishers, please see the Sovrn Website Privacy Policy and the Sovrn Commerce Website Privacy Policy.

By using the Sovrn Services or submitting Personal Information through our Sovrn Services, you acknowledge and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and to the processing of your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

##### What This Privacy Policy Covers

Through the Sovrn Services including the Sovrn publisher platform and other Sovrn publisher tools and widgets, the Sovrn ad exchange, Sovrn header bidding, Sovrn video products, Sovrn analytics and data services, the Sovrn Commerce affiliate linking services, and other Sovrn products and services (together the “ **Sovrn Services** “), we collect information about Publishers and Consumers. “ **Publishers** ” are websites or publications that use Sovrn Services, or natural persons who interact with Sovrn on behalf of such websites or publications. “ **Consumers** ” are individuals who visit our Publishers’ websites.

This Privacy Policy describes Sovrn’s use of Personal Information and Other Information that we collect when you use the Sovrn Services. “ **Personal Information** ” means any information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify a natural person, such as contact information (i.e., name, address, e-mail address, and/or phone number), any other data that is associated with the contact information, and/or information that uniquely and persistently identifies a browser or device such as an IP address, mobile advertising identifier, cookie identifier, or email address that has been hashed to generate an alphanumeric identifier, or combination of information about a browser or device (such as IP address and browser type/settings). “Other Information” means information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information including aggregate or de-identified information.

We collect and use Personal Information and Other Information as described in this Privacy Policy from both Publishers and Consumers. The practices described in this policy apply to both Publisher and Consumer information unless otherwise stated.

The Sovrn Services contain links to websites or content, including advertisements, operated and maintained by third parties, over which we have no control. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of a third-party website before disclosing any information to the website.

##### Information You Provide to Us

The Personal Information we gather helps us provide the Sovrn Services and learn more about how you use Sovrn Services. You may choose to provide us with Personal Information by interacting with us. For example, if you sign up for a mailing list or otherwise request information, we collect your email address. When you contact us by sending us an email or providing other feedback, we will collect any information that is contained in your email or feedback.

**Information from Publishers:** We collect additional Personal Information from Publishers. The Publisher registration process through Sovrn requires a valid email address and a username and password. For some of our Services, Publishers may register using an existing Google account. For Publishers who register through Google, we will receive your email address and profile information. We may also request information from you to support use of the Sovrn Services, such as the first and last name, bio, year of birth, telephone number, websites, software, mobile applications, log in IP addresses, physical address, zip code, and country of residence for the Publisher contact. We may collect information about the categories of content our Publishers typically make available to others on pages integrated with Sovrn Services and link this information to Personal Information provided for that account. For example, we categorize the types of content that Publishers make available. We collect payment information from Publishers who purchase Sovrn Services, including by participating in our advertising services. A Publisher may also choose to provide us with log-in credentials for accounts with third-party services such as online advertising providers, in order for Sovrn to provide services, such as reporting, based on information from those third-party services.

You can choose not to provide us with certain Personal Information, but this may limit the features of the Sovrn Services you are able to use.

##### Information Collected Via Technology

As you use the Sovrn Services as a Publisher or browse websites within the Sovrn Publisher network as a Consumer, certain information may also be collected passively (as described in this section), including your web viewing and search activities across unrelated websites, mobile application usage, browser agent, browser type, operating system, IP address (which may be used to generate your approximate geographic location), device type, mobile device identifiers, email address that has been hashed to generate an alphanumeric identifier, use of ad blocking tools, information about the possible relationships among different browsers and devices, and information about the precise location of your device (if you have allowed a website to collect your location through your browser or have enabled location services on a mobile device). This information may be linked to Personal Information that identifies your browser or device, including through cookies.

Sovrn Commerce enables Publishers to add links on locations including, but not limited to, webpages, sites, software, social media, and mobile applications to merchant destinations. When a Consumer clicks through Sovrn Commerce affiliated links to a merchant destination and then makes a purchase or submits a lead, the Publisher that generated the traffic is paid a referral fee or commission.

The term ‘cookies’ is used as an umbrella term for various technologies used to identify browsers, such as HTML cookies, Flash cookies, scripts, web beacons and pixel tags. With each of these technologies, a small (text) file is placed by a web server on the device visiting the website or service, which can be read out during further use. For convenience, these techniques are collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as “ **cookies** ”.

##### Sovrn may store cookies on your device:

  * For Publishers, to allow you to use our Sovrn Services, and access secure areas of the Sovrn Services. Without these cookies, it is not possible to load or offer key functionalities on our website, such as logging in to your account, displaying dynamic elements or uploading information.
  * For both Publishers and Consumers, for statistical purposes and to analyze and improve the use and performance of our Sovrn Services and to do the same for our Publishers’ websites.
  * For Consumers, to support the Sovrn Services that are described in this policy, such as for our analytics and data services and to provide Consumers with interest-based advertising, including through Google’s Exchange Bidding service, and the ability to opt out of such advertising as further described in this Privacy Policy.



Our Sovrn Services may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your device until you delete them). For more information about how cookies are used or what information we collect, please [click here](https://www.sovrn.com/about-our-cookies/).

##### Information from Other Sources

We may receive Other Information as well as Personal Information about you from other sources, and combine it with the information that we collect through the Sovrn Services. In addition to the types of information described above, this Personal Information may include, for example, mobile advertising identifiers, information about your activities across unrelated websites or mobile applications, demographic information, email address that has been hashed to generate an alphanumeric identifier, information about the possible relationships between different browsers and devices, information about you from offline sources, and/or precise information about the past or present location of a mobile device. These sources may include information conveyed to us by telephone or fax, information that we receive from third-party data providers, or information provided to us by third parties in a Publisher network.

##### For Consumers: Interest-Based Advertising and Opting Out

For our legitimate business interests, and with your consent where this is required, we may process and disclose your Personal Information for interest-based advertising as described in this section.

**Opting Out of Sovrn’s Activities:** Sovrn collects, uses, and discloses web viewing data, app usage data, and precise location data across non-affiliated sites and apps over time for the purpose of delivering interest-based advertising to this device or different devices. You can choose to opt out of Sovrn’s interest-based advertising activities on your device. If you choose to opt out, we will not collect, use, or transfer such data from or on the device that you opted out, for the purpose of interest-based advertising.

If you wish to opt out of Sovrn’s collection, use, or transfer of such data from your browser for interest-based advertising purposes, you can visit <https://www.aboutads.info/> to learn more about interest-based advertising and to exercise your opt-out choice with respect to Sovrn and other companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) self-regulatory program.

If you wish to opt-out of Sovrn’s collection, use, or transfer of such data from your mobile device for interest-based advertising purposes, you can download the DAA’s AppChoices app from your device’s application store. If you opt out through AppChoices, we will not collect, use or transfer such data from or on that device for interest-based advertising.

When you use the opt-out tools above, your choice will be effective only on the browser or device where you exercised the choice. If you use a different device or browser, you will need to renew your opt-out choice. Our opt-out tool for browsers is cookie-based. It will be installed only if your browser is set to accept third-party cookies, and if you delete this cookie then you will need to renew your opt-out choice. Even if you opt out on your browser or your mobile device, we may continue to collect, use and transfer such data for other purposes such as contextual advertising based on a current visit to a website, fraud prevention, improving site performance and other purposes referred to in this Privacy Policy.

Opting out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser. Even if you opt out, you still may receive advertising from the Sovrn Services when you visit websites of a Publisher who uses our Services, but that advertising will not be targeted to you. If you opt out of Sovrn’s practices, you may also continue to receive interest-based advertising through other companies.

**Opting Out of Sovrn Commerce:** If you want Sovrn Commerce to stop collecting or storing personal data about the websites you visit, the links you click, or the merchants you make purchases from, you can choose to opt-out out of Sovrn Commerce cookies using our [opt-out page](https://www.viglink.com/opt-out). Opting out of Sovrn Commerce cookies means that Sovrn Commerce will stop placing cookies on your device when you browse Sovrn Commerce enabled websites and/or links. To honor your opt-out choice, we need to place a cookie on your device so that we know not to track your activity. Clearing your browser’s cache or cookies will remove this cookie, and you will be required to opt-out of tracking again. Similarly, if you access sites that use Sovrn Commerce from a different browser or device than the browser or device you opted out of tracking on, you will be required to opt-out again.

##### Use of Personal Information

We process Personal Information to enable our business, including but not limited to the following:

  * **For Consumers:**
    * We will use your Personal Information to provide interest-based advertising and to support third parties’ interest-based advertising activities as described above.

##### Use of Other Information

We may use Other Information for a variety of purposes to operate and improve the Sovrn Services.

As examples, we may use Other Information for purposes that include testing our IT systems, analyzing usage patterns, market research, data analysis, improving the Sovrn Services and developing new products.

We may also use Other Information on Consumers’ activities at Publisher websites, such as page views, use of ad blocking technology, and search queries, to provide aggregate information to Publishers so that they can improve their offerings.

  * **Other Information:** We may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose in our discretion, to the extent permitted under applicable law. If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we may use or disclose it for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information.



##### Data Retention

**For Publishers:** We will keep Publishers’ Personal Information for the length of any contractual relationship you have with us, and, to the extent permitted, after the end of that relationship for as long as necessary to perform the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. This includes maintaining Publishers’ Personal Information after our relationship ends to protect ourselves from legal claims, to comply with law, or to administer our business.

**For Consumers:** For Personal Information collected through our Sovrn Commerce services, our policy is to retain Consumers’ Personal Information for a maximum of eighteen months. Consumer Personal Information collected through all other Sovrn Services is to be retained for a maximum of one year. However, laws, legal claims or other particular circumstances may require us to keep certain Personal Information longer.

We may retain Other Information for our business purposes, in our discretion or as permitted by law.

You can also contact us in order to change your preferences with respect to promotional emails (or other contacts if you are registered as a Publisher) by emailing us at [marketing@sovrn.com](mailto:marketing@sovrn.com). We will send you messages related to our relationship or transactions with you. You may not opt-out of these communications, but if you do not wish to receive these announcements, you have the option to deactivate your account as discussed below.

For Consumers, please see above for information on opting out of Sovrn’s collection, use and transfer of data for interest-based advertising purposes.

##### For Publishers: Access and Changes to Your Personal Information

In order to access and remove or modify this bio and display name, and/or other contact information that is not displayed, you may login to your Sovrn account, select the “Account” option, and edit the contact details. To prevent any other information from the account being displayed by the Sovrn Services, you may contact us at [publishersupport@sovrn.com](mailto:publishersupport@sovrn.com) to deactivate your account.

##### Additional Rights for Residents of the European Economic Area (EEA)

You may be entitled to ask us for a copy of your Personal Information, to correct it, to erase or restrict its processing, or to ask us to transfer some of this information to other organizations. As further detailed in other sections of this Privacy Policy, you may also have rights to object to some processing, such as profiling we perform for the purposes of direct marketing and interest-based advertisement, and, where we have asked for your consent to process your data, to withdraw this consent. In some cases, you can exercise these rights through automated means. Where this is not possible you can contact us through our [web form](https://www.sovrn.com/your-data/) or through the contact details provided under the “Contact Us” section later in this Privacy Policy. These rights may be limited in some situations – for example, where we can demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process your data. In some instances, this may mean that we are able to retain data even if you withdraw your consent.

Where we require Personal Information to comply with legal or contractual obligations, then provision of such data is mandatory: if such data is not provided, then we will not be able to manage our contractual relationship, or to meet obligations placed on us. In all other cases, provision of requested Personal Information is optional.

Under Nevada law, Publishers who are Nevada residents may submit a request directing us not to make certain sales of personal information we maintain about them that is covered by Nevada law, if we make such sales in the future.
