 **II. TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS**

 **A.  Data We Collect; Purpose of Collection and Use; Legal Basis and Data Retention**

 **Data We Collect.**  Our accredited Technology Solutions serves both advertisers and media sellers by providing independent, third-party verification measurement. By analyzing information about ad impression delivery and website traffic, IAS verifies whether the media has met or failed expectations based on characteristics that include the brand safety of a webpage, the viewability of the ad placement, the existence of ad fraud, as well as additional contextual variables.Measurement is available across both browser and app environments for mobile and desktop devices. IAS collects and surfaces this data to increase trust and transparency for its customers. The data collected can be used by customers to proactively prevent advertising on undesirable and/or low-quality inventory, monitor overall quality performance, and make future media planning decisions. We do not combine the collected data with any other data that would enable us to personally identify the user.

In order to provide Technology Solutions to our clients, we use pixels and other similar technologies (see “Our Tools” below) that places a small piece of HTML code on a webpage to collect information about advertising impression opportunities and displayed ads or website/mobile app traffic. The following categories of Personal Data are collected when these technologies are deployed when providing Technology Solutions to our clients:

  * Browser and computer environmental information. This information is necessary to determine the viewability of an advertisement, which includes information such as the ad’s location in the browser viewport, size of the browser viewport, ad size, size of the display, application in focus, the browser tab in focus, and other data.
  * Standard HTTP header information. This includes IP address, referring URL, user agent data (data transmitted by your browser about itself when submitting an HTTP request) and other data including browser configuration parameters, including browser type and language and session storage and local storage settings, and characteristics of your device such as the CPU class and time zone setting.
  * Information contained within an advertisement. This is known as an “ad tag,” that includes information used to identify the advertiser displaying the ad and the media property that sold the impression.
  * Mobile application and mobile device data. Examples include log-level data, Personal Data about users’ interactions with those applications (including IP address and time-stamp Personal Data), and Personal Data about users’ mobile devices (including device type, device make and model, operating system type and version).



  
For the purpose of identifying and preventing online ad impression fraud and invalid traffic and determining if advertisers and publishers are in compliance with their agreements, our Technology Solutions utilize the following additional technologies (in addition to the data described above):

  * Device identification technology, which analyzes device parameters collected as described above, including IP address and browser header information, to probabilistically identify a particular device.
  * Clickstream data including URLs and other data regarding the websites on which a particular browser has viewed advertising impressions we are analyzing.
  * Clickstream data including mobile application identifier and other data regarding the mobile apps on which a particular user has viewed advertising impressions.
  * Webpage (HTML and Javascript) structure analysis.



 **  
Mobile device tracking opt-out.**  Individual users that opt-out of mobile device tracking limit the Personal Data that is collected about them and/or how it is used. Individual users may opt-out of interest-based and demographic-based advertising using their mobile device settings. Individual users will need to follow the below instructions for Android and iOS applications.

Opt-out process for Android-based mobile devices:

  * Open the Google Settings app on individual users’ device
  * Select Ads
  * Set the “Opt-out of interest-based ads” slider to individual users’ desired position
  * Optionally, Individual users may reset the advertising identifier associated with their device



  
Opt-out process for iOS-based mobile devices:

  * Open Settings
  * Select Privacy
  * Select Advertising
  * Set the “Limit Ad Tracking” slider to Individual users’ desired position
  * Optionally, Individual users may reset the advertising identifier associated with their device



Please note that opting out through a website (see, “Automatic Data Collection,” and “Other Third Party Services,” above) will not limit the collection of Personal Data on mobile devices, and opting out on Individual users’ mobile device will not limit the collection of Personal Data through Individual users’ computer’s browser. Opting out limits the collection of data but does not eliminate it completely. Some Personal Data will still be collected about Individual users’ use of websites or mobile applications after Individual users limit tracking on that platform.

 **Cookie-grade data.**  Our Technology Solutions use pixel tags, SDKs, and cookies to enable campaign performance analytics and optimization services on behalf of our clients. While we collect information about browsers, devices, and how users interact with web and mobile content, the cookies we attempt to set for our Activation services do not contain any directly identifiable Personal Data such as name or email address in the cookie itself. Rather, we use pseudonymous identifiers such as a unique cookie ID for measurements pertaining to ad viewability and user interactions with the ad.

 **Purpose of Collection and Use.**  We use the data we collect to deliver our Technology Solutions for any lawful purpose, including:

  * Examining impression data of advertising opportunities, using IAS technology and client profile decisions, to determine if clients’ advertisements should or should not be displayed.
  * Detailing contextual information about advertisements displayed in order to ensure its compliance with terms of our client or partner’s contracts, insertion orders that detail client campaigns, and/or profile decisions that clients make in our systems.
  * Reporting viewability metrics of advertisements that indicate: qualified “Viewed Impressions” according to industry standards and/or clients’ criteria, time in which advertisements are displayed on consumers’ browsers, and properties of creative elements that are displayed on consumers’ browsers.
  * Website and mobile apps visitation characteristics such as visitor quality, fraud identification, invalid traffic detection, and other quality characteristics necessary to determine agreement compliance.
  * Providing enhanced measurement services and insight for our clients through our aggregation of audience demographics (often from partners who independently collect and delivery this data) and brand lift metrics from advertisement impression data.



  
Our Technology Solutions include the detection and elimination of general invalid and sophisticated invalid traffic, including ad impression fraud, which we define in this policy as the management of ad serving, ad display, or traffic activity such that ad impression measurements are shown inappropriately because the ads cannot be viewed by a user, are not served within operationally viewable parameters or were displayed as a result of fraudulent machine-generated traffic. Our fraud and invalid traffic services are intended to address fraud for advertising measurement purposes.

Additionally, IAS uses advertising impression information, mobile app information, and website traffic information including IP address and browser header information to:

  * Identify traffic sources by their geographic location and determine if the location is correct and located within the advertiser’s campaign parameters or traffic settings
  * Determine if traffic is being acquired is fraudulent, or if traffic acquisition practices that are out of compliance with an advertiser’s guidelines or contractual requirements.
  * Determine if a middleware is attempting to misrepresent its operating characteristics to prevent the identification of fraud or other invalid traffic.
  * Determine if traffic or ad impressions are originating from a server farm unlikely to be responsible for human-generated browsing activity.



  
IAS leverages AI and Machine Learning in order to automate the process of detecting invalid traffic and fraudulent activity.

 **Legal Basis and Data Retention**

We process pseudonymous Personal Data (notably your IP address) along with non-personal technical information when necessary to do so for fraud and invalid traffic prevention purposes or providing services related to advertising viewability and brand safety as discussed in this policy, when these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights. Where we process your personal data for this purpose, our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and members.

We minimize our use of Personal Data by, for example, truncating the IP address after 30 days. The resulting string of digits provides us with research value but may no longer represent a unique device or household. We retain our clients reporting data for up to 13 months.

 **B. Our Tools**

 **Use of Pixel Tags.**  We may set cookies associated with pixel tags where authorized by clients within their email messages and on their own websites.

Pixels (also sometimes referred to as beacons or web beacons) and tags are elements included in web pages to enable companies to collect data, serve advertising, and provide related services, such as measuring ad effectiveness or preventing fake ad traffic. They do this by allowing communication between a web browser and a server. A beacon is a small transparent image that is placed on a web page. A tag is a small piece of website code that is run by the web browser. Pixel tags are small, invisible images on a web page or other document. Pixel tags allow the operator of the web page or other document, or a third party who serves the pixel tag, to set, read, and modify cookies and to directly collect Personal Data from browsers and devices. Our pixel tags allow cookies to be set, read, and modified when Individual users visit a website, and directly collect the Personal Data described under “Data We Collect.”

[ **Use of Cookies**](https://integralads.com/cookie-policy/) **.**  Our Technology Solutions may set cookies (including with mobile browsers) to enable campaign performance analytics and optimization services on behalf of our clients. We collect and process information about browsers, devices, and how users interact with web and mobile content, through the use of pixel tags and SDKs that enable us to associate unique cookie IDs with a browser. We use cookie and similar tools for measuring ad viewability and user interactions with the ad, as well as other elements of the web page on which the ad is displayed, in many cases, across unaffiliated websites visited by the same user. We or other third party service providers may deploy and read these unique pseudonymous IDs, and thus passively “collect” them, when users go to a website or application where our pixel tags, SDKs, and/or cookies are deployed.

 **Use of SDKs.**  We also use, or partner with publishers or publisher-facing and application developer platforms that use mobile SDKs, to collect the types of Personal Data described under “Log-level data,” and “Cookies.” An SDK is a piece of computer code that developers include in their mobile applications. A mobile SDK is in effect the mobile app version of a pixel tag or beacon. The SDK is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services to be implemented. We may use this technology, for instance, to analyze or measure certain advertising through mobile applications and browsers based on Personal Data associated with a mobile device.

 **Use of Cross-Device and Cross-App Technology.**  We may work with third parties that provide cross-device and cross-app technology to establish connections among devices (such as mobile devices, tablets, and computers) used by an individual. We may share pseudonymous identifiers (such as cookies **or Google Advertising IDs** ) with those third parties to assist in connecting devices. Using these connections, we may combine Personal Data about an individual’s use of websites or applications on his/her current device, with usage Personal Data from his/her other devices. We use this Personal Data to provide Technology Solutions to our clients to enable campaign performance analytics and optimization services on behalf of our clients.

 **III. PERSONAL DATA SHARED WITH THIRD PARTIES**

 **Onward Transfer to Third Parties.**  Like many businesses, we hire other companies to perform certain business-related services. We may disclose Personal Data to certain types of third party companies but only to the extent needed to enable them to provide such services. The types of companies that may receive Personal Data and their functions are: direct marketing assistance (including disclosure to our distributors for direct marketing of Technology Solutions), billing, client service, data storage, hosting services, disaster recovery services, and credit card processors. All such third parties function as our agents, performing services at our instruction and on our behalf pursuant to contracts which require they provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by this Privacy Policy and implemented by IAS. We may also disclose Personal Data to our affiliates in order to support marketing, sale and delivery of Technology Solutions.
